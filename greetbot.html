          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif text-dimmed">Conversational Interface Design, Product Management, Responsive Web Design, Web&nbsp;Development</p>
          <p class="fs-4 text-normal text-serif">GreetBot is a chatbot for onboarding new employees on Slack. Before it was acquired in 2022, GreetBot sent over 5 million welcome messages to more than 4 million people across 14,000+ organizations worldwide and was ranked #4 fastest growing app on Slack in 2018. I led a team of 3 full-stack software engineers in scaling the initial prototype to the fully-featured B2B SaaS solution, designed chat and web UI deployed in production, and was the main contributor to the HTML and Sass code base.</p>
          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">Background</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">In 2015 I spent 6 months living in Thailand, where I worked remotely as a freelance web designer. Inspired by this experience, after coming back home to Amsterdam, I formed a collective of freelancers and indie makers, dedicated to exploring novel product ideas and collaboration practices enabled by new technologies. The group soon converged on the issue of making new team members feel welcome when they joined a distributed team. Even though Slack had already existed, welcoming new teammates online felt infinitely more complicated than in real life. We asked ourselves, how could we bridge that gap?</p>
          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">Proof of Concept</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">In early October 2016 a few of us gathered for a 2-day hackathon to work on this problem. In order to ensure we could complete a working prototype within this timeframe we settled on the following deliverables:</p>
          <ul class="mb-3 fs-5 text-normal text-serif">
            <li>Narrowed scope: a chatbot instead of a web app.</li>
            <li>Setup inside Slack using predefined, text-based commands.</li>
            <li>Sign-up using a single landing page.</li>
            <li>Launch on Hacker News.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">Betting on Conversational UI</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">Using a chat-based interface allowed us to avoid the myriad of peripheral requirements associated with web development, such as support for different screen sizes and browsers, and focus on functionality instead. Building a Slack app also enabled us to tap into a large audience of software engineering teams and communities on the platform, already used to command-line interfaces.</p>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">By using a simple dialogue tree we could guide users through a configuration process without forcing them to ever leave Slack. It was a user-centric strategy that also helped ensure high activation rates. We doubled-down on this approach, gradually expanding the dialogue tree to support more configuration options and account for a range of edge cases.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">Going Viral</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">GreetBot’s unique ability wast that it spread organically from one Slack workspace to another. Every welcome message that we delivered was essentially an ad for the service. And the more messages were sent, the more people discovered the app.</p>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">To drive user activation, and support this organic growth, I focused primarily on simplifying the setup process:</p>
          <ul class="mb-3 fs-5 text-normal text-serif">
            <li>Slack sign-in with no need for separate account setup.</li>
            <li>Configuration performed entirely in Slack.</li>
            <li>Convenient message templates to reduce user effort.</li>
            <li>Automated functionality requiring minimum user input.</li>
            <li>Self-service knowledge base, including FAQs and tutorials.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">By mid-2018 GreetBot was adding hundreds of new Slack workspaces every month and sending tens of thousands of welcome messages every week. It was ranked as the 4th fastest-growing Slack app of 2018, ahead of Google Drive and Zoom.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">Shift to a Web Interface</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">While conversational UI had its merits, as the product matured and attracted a wider audience, we realized it had significant drawbacks, too. Most importantly, it could be slow and tedious. Users could not always jump ahead, but had to patiently sit through the configuration process each time they wanted to make a change. This was especially painful for power users that needed to interact with the app multiple times a day. On the back-end we also relied on Slack’s API, which extended the time before each command could be processed. As a result, in the fall of 2020 we made the decision to shift to a web interface.</p>

Every e-mail we got, good or bad, was essentially user feedback, and I wanted to hear directly from our customers what worked and didn’t work for them. I documented any reported issues and regularly discussed them with the engineering team to evaluate whether we could integrate them into our the product roadmap or address them in the form of how-to articles. In cases where additional information was required, I reached out to users to set up video calls and discuss the problems they were facing in more detail.</p>

              <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">One of the most consequential issues that emerged from my interactions with users was the security and compliance needs of our enterprise customers. As a small, bootstrapped company we did not have the resources to obtain a formal SOC 2 certification. But based on conversations we were having with enterprise IT Admins we were able to develop documentation that reassured them about the standards that we followed and the safeguards we put in place to protect their data. While it wasn’t always enough, and we’ve lost several prospective customers early on, eventually we were able to overcome this challenge and sign up several others.</p>

          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">Despite being a small team of only 3–4 people with no venture funding, in the 5 years since the initial hackathon, we went on to turn GreetBot into one of the most popular apps on the Slack platform:</p>
          <ul class="mb-3 fs-5 text-normal text-serif">
            <li>Used across 14,000+ organizations worldwide, including global brands such as IBM, Porsche, SAP.</li>
            <li>Welcomed more than 4 million Slack users.</li>
            <li>Sent 50-70K messages weekly, over 5 million messages total.</li>
            <li>Ranked 4th fastest growing Slack app of 2018.</li>
            <li>Featured in Slack’s 2019 Frontiers conference keynote in San Francisco.</li>
            <li>Ranked #13 most popular app in the HR & Team Culture category on the Slack App Directory in 2022.</li>
            <li>Acquired in 2022.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">The project proved that simple solutions can be highly effective at addressing complex problems. It also showed that setting constraints around product development, like time-boxing the prototyping phase, can often lead to unexpected solutions that wouldn’t emerge otherwise.</p>
