          <p class="mb-1 lead text-normal text-serif">Maker &middot; 2018–2020</p>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif text-dimmed">Conversational Interface Design, Product&nbsp;Design, UX&nbsp;Writing</p>
          <p class="fs-4 text-normal text-serif">Hiki was a Slack-based skill directory for distributed teams. I developed the concept, lead the design of its command-line interface, contributed to the HTML and Sass code base, wrote the website copy and created marketing materials. Despite a promising start the product did not attract enough users and was discontinued 18 months after release.</p>
          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">Background</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">Hiki was conceived out of a desire to develop better awareness about your teammates’ skills. Especially in the context of the larger, distributed teams, it wasn’t always apparent who the right people to talk to about a specific topic were. This made it harder to develop working relationships, especially for new team members, impacting team morale and productivity.</p>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">We wanted instead to put a system in place that would turn online profiles into richer, more pliable and more personal portraits of who individual team members actually were. Something that would help teams get to know each other better and bring them closer together. Even if they were thousands of miles apart.</p>
          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">Minimum Viable Product</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">The product we envisioned was a skill directory for Slack. Team members would be able to tag each other with skills in any channel or group chat, each tag adding to the person’s individual skill profile, as well as the profile of the team as a whole. Skills could also be up- or down-voted to reflect the relative expertise of each team member. </p>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">We considered the following 3 main use cases:</p>
          <ul class="mb-3 fs-5 text-normal text-serif">
            <li>Giving and getting credit for contributions</li>
            <li>Finding colleagues to ask for help or socialize with</li>
            <li>Seeing what the team is capable of</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">A Word About Branding</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">After some initial detours, we’ve landed on the name Hiki, which is Hawaiian for “to be able to.” It was also a play on the word “wiki,” intended to reflect the crowd-sourcing nature of the product. Most importantly, it was a short, easy to spell and pronounce name that felt fun and playful. Of course, the resemblance to the word “hickey” was not lost on us. But we thought the risqué connotation was worth it, as we were hoping the similarity would make the name more memorable and easier to recall.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-4 heading-normal">Soft Launch</h2>
          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">We chose to launch the product on the Slack App Directory without much of a fanfare to see whether the product organically attracted any interest from Slack alone. We also wanted to get some early feedback and iron out any bugs before making any official announcements.</p>

          <p class="fs-5 text-normal text-serif">Although we’ve received promising feedback at first, including interest for an acquisition from another tech company, ultimately the product did not attract enough users to warrant further development. The issues that contributed to this most likely were (1) insufficient marketing and (2) usability issues associated with the command-line interface. Without any marketing the product struggled to find its audience, while the command-line interface was too hard to use, even for those who did find it. The combination of these two proved to be hard to overcome given the limited resources we had, and we decided to shift our focus to Greet.Bot instead.</p>
